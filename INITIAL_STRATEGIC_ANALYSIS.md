# Initial Strategic Analysis
## Buick GMC Wilmington - Performance Improvement Plan

**Prepared:** November 4, 2025
**Objective:** Increase from 30-35 units/month to consistent 35-40 units/month

---

## 🎯 Current Situation Analysis

### The Numbers
- **Current Performance:** 30-35 units/month
- **Goal:** 35-40 units/month
- **Gap:** 5-10 units/month (14-29% increase needed)
- **Sales Team:** 6 professionals
- **Current Productivity:** 5-6 units per person/month
- **Industry Standard:** 8-12 units per person/month
- **Competition:** 6 dealerships within 50 miles

### Critical Insight
**Your sales team has significant untapped capacity!** At current 5-6 units/person, you're operating at 50% of industry average productivity. Even reaching 7 units/person would get you to 42 units/month (exceeding your 40-unit goal).

---

## 💡 Immediate Action Plan (Next 30 Days)

### 1. **Sales Team Performance Tracking** (Week 1)
**Action:** Use your new tracker to identify individual performance patterns

**Track These Metrics:**
- Units per salesperson this month vs. last month
- Lead-to-sale conversion rate by salesperson
- F&I penetration rate by salesperson
- Average days to close by salesperson

**Expected Outcome:** Identify your top 1-2 performers and bottom 1-2 performers

**Quick Win Example:**
```
If Jim Vandyke averages 8 units/month and Chris Meeks averages 4 units/month:
- Study Jim's process, lead sources, and techniques
- Have Jim mentor Chris
- If Chris increases to 6 units/month = +2 units for dealership
- Repeat with remaining 4 salespeople = +8-10 additional units
```

---

### 2. **Lead Source Optimization** (Week 1-2)
**Action:** Track where every sale originates

**Lead Sources to Track:**
- Walk-in (city location advantage)
- Phone/Internet inquiries
- Referrals (existing customers)
- Repeat customers
- Conquest (from 6 competitors)
- Fleet/commercial (city market)

**Goal:** Find your highest conversion lead source and double down

**Expected Impact:** +2-3 units/month from optimized lead focus

---

### 3. **Delaware Tax Advantage Marketing** (Week 2-3)
**Action:** Aggressive marketing of DE's no sales tax benefit

**Target Markets:**
- Philadelphia buyers (30 miles away, high PA sales tax)
- Baltimore buyers (70 miles away, MD sales tax)
- New Jersey buyers (across river, high NJ sales tax)

**Marketing Channels:**
- Digital ads targeting zip codes in PA, NJ, MD
- "Save Thousands - No Sales Tax in Delaware" messaging
- Calculate exact savings on popular models
- Weekend "Out-of-State Buyer Events"

**Expected Impact:** +3-5 conquest units/month

---

### 4. **Individual Sales Person Goals** (Week 1, Ongoing)
**Action:** Set clear individual targets with accountability

**New Individual Targets:**
```
Current Team Average: 5.5 units/person/month (33 total)
Step 1 Goal: 6.5 units/person/month (39 total) ✓ Reaches goal!
Step 2 Goal: 7.0 units/person/month (42 total) ✓ Exceeds goal!

Individual Monthly Targets:
- Jim Vandyke: 7 units
- Chris Meeks: 7 units
- Sam Williams: 7 units
- Andrea Guido: 7 units
- Tom Guido: 7 units
- Javier Aviles: 7 units
Total: 42 units (exceeds 40-unit goal)
```

**Accountability System:**
- Weekly one-on-ones with each salesperson
- Public leaderboard (friendly competition)
- Bonus structure for hitting 7+ units
- Coaching plan for anyone below 5 units

**Expected Impact:** Culture shift toward higher performance

---

### 5. **F&I Penetration Focus** (Week 2-4)
**Action:** Maximize profit per unit (since you need to "step it up")

**Current Industry Benchmarks:**
- Financing: 60-70% penetration
- Warranty: 50-60% penetration
- Insurance: 30-40% penetration

**Strategy:**
- Train salespeople on F&I product benefits (not F&I manager's job alone)
- Create "product presentation" before F&I office
- Track penetration rates by salesperson
- Reward high F&I penetration

**Expected Impact:** May not increase units, but increases profit per unit significantly
- If you sell 35 units at +$500/unit F&I profit = +$17,500/month profit
- Annualized: +$210,000 in profit without selling one more car!

---

### 6. **Weekend Warrior Strategy** (Week 3-4)
**Action:** Maximize Saturday/Sunday traffic

**Why This Matters:**
- Most customers shop weekends
- 6 competitors are also open weekends (need to stand out)
- Suburban market families shop together on weekends

**Weekend Initiatives:**
- "Saturday Sales Blitz" - all 6 salespeople working, high energy
- Weekend-only special offers
- Kid-friendly environment (balloons, snacks) for family shoppers
- Extended Sunday hours (if not already doing this)
- Fresh inventory staged for weekend shoppers

**Expected Impact:** +2-4 units/month from optimized weekend conversion

## 📊 Sales Person Performance Analysis Framework

Use your new tracker to run this analysis monthly:

### Top Performer Analysis
**Identify Your Best (probably 1-2 people at 7+ units/month):**
- What lead sources do they work best?
- What's their follow-up process?
- How quickly do they close deals?
- What's their F&I penetration rate?
- What makes them successful?

**Action:** Document and replicate their process

### Bottom Performer Support
**Identify Who Needs Help (probably 1-2 people at 3-4 units/month):**
- Are they getting enough leads? (Lead distribution issue)
- Are they converting leads? (Skills/training issue)
- Are they following up? (Process/discipline issue)
- Do they need different lead types? (Matching issue)

**Action:** Targeted coaching and support (not criticism)

### Middle Performer Potential
**The 3-4 people at 5-6 units/month:**
- Biggest opportunity for growth
- Already competent, need optimization
- Getting them to 7-8 units solves your entire problem

**Action:** Focused skill development and motivation

## 💰 The Math: What Stepping It Up Means

### Current State (low end)
- 30 units/month × 12 months = **360 units/year**

### Goal State
- 40 units/month × 12 months = **480 units/year**
- **+120 additional units per year!**

### Profit Impact (Conservative Estimate)
Assuming $2,000 average profit per unit:
- 120 additional units × $2,000 = **+$240,000 annual profit**

With improved F&I:
- 120 units × $2,500 average profit = **+$300,000 annual profit**

**That's why you need to "step it up" - significant profit opportunity!**
